\section{Introduction}.\newline
The Emerging Technology that I am focusing on for my Literature Review is Bitcoin. So what exactly is Bitcoin?\newline
Bitcoin is basically the first ever created decentralized digital Currency. Bitcoin was first created in 2009 by a unknown entity or entities taking the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. that person or persons are still anonymous to this present day. When creating bitcoin Satoshi had also implemented the first ever blockchain database. Bitcoin is known as a peer-2-peer system or P2P\newline It is a transaction system that takes out the middleman in most cases the banks. This results in a very low transaction costs for a user. Bitcoin can be used to pay for virtually anything you want, It is a neutral currency. Bitcoin Transactions are managed by miners these are people who verify P2P transactions and are rewarded by newly generated Bitcoins. Once the transactions are verified by the miners they are then recorded and saved in the Public Ledger. Since bitcoins emergence in 2009 it has steadily grown and is used more and more frequently as a means of paying for goods and services but is bitcoin a secure form of Currency or is it too early to know in the next sections I shall be looking at this cryptocurrency and how its design is secure?
\section{Blockchain}.\newline
Blockchain technology is the essential component to bitcoins goal of the P2P system,Since the blockchain is a decentralized system meaning it does not need a trusted 3rd party to make transactions \newline Blockchain stores the transaction information of every single transaction ever made across a network of personal computers,Which means that no central company or person owns the blockchain system but everybody can still access it and help to maintain & run it. The Blockchain is the fundamental piece of the puzzle that makes a P2P system very hard to compromise,as it has no central point to attack,compared to a Trusted party system where there usually main point of centralization.that's not to say it is impossible Satoshi Nakamoto had mentioned in his article that if the users of the system were out
