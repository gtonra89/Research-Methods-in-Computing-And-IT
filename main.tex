\section{Introduction}The Emerging Technology that I am focusing on for my Literature Review is Bitcoin. So what exactly is Bitcoin?\newline
Bitcoin is basically the first ever created decentralized digital Currency. Bitcoin was first created in 2009 by a unknown entity or entities taking the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. that person or persons are still anonymous to this present day. When creating bitcoin Satoshi had also implemented the first ever blockchain database. Bitcoin is known as a peer-2-peer system or P2P\newline It is a transaction system that takes out the middleman in most cases the banks. This results in a very low transaction costs for a user. Bitcoin can be used to pay for virtually anything you want, It is a neutral currency meaning it you can buy/sell bitcoin for virtually any currency that you desire. If you were in America you could sell your bitcoin for the Dollar equivalent,while if in China the seller will be able to sell it for Yen if desired. Bitcoin Transactions are managed by miners these are people who verify P2P transactions and are rewarded by newly generated Bitcoins. Once the transactions are verified by the miners they are then recorded and saved in the Public Ledger. Since bitcoins emergence in 2009 it has steadily grown and is used more and more frequently as a means of paying for goods and services but is bitcoin a secure form of Currency ?
